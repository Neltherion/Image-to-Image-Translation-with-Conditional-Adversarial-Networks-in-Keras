# Image-to-Image-Translation-in-Keras

This is an attempt to code the [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) paper in Keras.

It's already been [implemented in Torch/Lua](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) but since I'm on Windows and can't use that environment I ended up trying to write in in Keras/Theano.
